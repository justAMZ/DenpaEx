This is where your data .jsons go.

This is also where you should place your .txt for credits and patch notes.
They should be labled "credits.txt" or "patch.txt".
Formatting is as follows:

username::icon::name::role::description::link::color

version::icon::name::subtitle::notes::link::color

This is also where you put your txt file that dictates your skins.
Should be seperated by ::s. i.e. FNF::Kade::Denpa etc
