ALL CREDIT GOES TO THE DENPA ENGINE DEVELOPERS! THIS FORK ONLY HAS A HANDFUL OF FEATURES THAT WOULDNT BE DONE WITHOUT THEIR HELP IN THE DISCORD SERVER!
(also the freeplay menu is a bit fucky lol itll be fixed in 5 days or less)

## Synopsis

DenpaEx is a Friday Night Funkin': Denpa Engine Fork made by justAMZ. It adds a small amount of extra features on top of normal Denpa Engine, created by the likes of BlueVapor1234, Toadette8394, YanniZ06, jorge, MemeHoovy, Ziad, and much much more. Being intended to enhance the user experience, improve game performance, and increase the capabilities and efficiency of mod making, Denpa Engine (as well as this fork) is the most feature ready FNF engine to date. With features ranging from HScript and Lua scripting, to fully fitted editors, the engine is ready to go right out of the box.
